## EE769 Course Project - Adithya Somaraj

The objective of this project is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. 

In the training sample of tweets and labels, label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist. The objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

For training the models, a labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets is used. The dataset is in the form of a csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.
